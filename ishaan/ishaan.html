            <p class="bioDesc">Nice to meet you! I'm a senior and I'm going into CS in college. 
            I've got a lot of Java and Python experience, but for this class I'm trying to hone in my front-end skills (HTML and CSS) through projects like this website. 
            My hobbies are reading/writing fanfiction, playing videogames, and hanging out with my friends!</p>
